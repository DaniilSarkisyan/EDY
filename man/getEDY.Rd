\usage{
getEDY(x, gender.var, male.key, gene.key, coef = 1.2, log = TRUE,
  group.var, control.key, experiment.type, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An ExpressionSet or RangedSummarizedExperiment from microarray or
RNAseq experiments.}

\item{gender.var}{A string indicating the name of the column in the table of
phenotype (accessed by \code{pData} or \code{colData}) that contains the
gender of the individual.}

\item{male.key}{A string indicating the symbol that idendtifies males (eg.:
"male", "M", ...).}

\item{gene.key}{A string indicating the name of the column that contains the
Gene Symbol in the table of features (accessed by \code{fData} or
\code{rowData}).}

\item{coef}{Numerical. Value to consider an outlier when calling LOY. Default
correspond to 1.2 which keeps 5\% of data in the normal case.}

\item{log}{Logical. It is set to \code{TRUE} if the gene expression values
are given in a logarithmic scale in the ExpressionSet and \code{FALSE}
otherwise. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{group.var}{A string indicating the name of the column that contains the
information about if the individual is case or control (accessed by
\code{pData} or \code{colData}).}

\item{control.key}{A string indicating the symbol that identifies control
group (eg.: "control").}

\item{experiment.type}{A string indicating if the data set is a
\strong{microarray} or a \strong{RNAseq} experiment}
}
\value{
A list containing 4 objects: 
\itemize{ 
  \item \code{EDY}: a factor with two levels, \code{NO} and \code{YES} , 
    that indicates whether the individual has EDY or not.
  \item \code{EDYcontinuous}: a vector with individual relative expression
    of chromosome Y with regard the autosomal genes.
  \item \code{threshold}: a number indicating the threshold from which down 
    an individual is considered to have EDY. 
  \item \code{eSet} or \code{RangedSummarizedExperiment}: an ExpressionSet 
    or RangedSummarizedExperiment that contains only males from the initial
    data set.   
  }

\description{
Detection of individuals with Extreme Downregulation of chromosome Y (EDY)
from transcriptomic data
}
\details{
To assess EDY, we calculate the mean expression of chrY genes divided by the
mean expression of genes in the rest of the genome (for each individual).
Now, the following formulae is applied only with individuals in the control
group, or with all the individuals in case it does not exist such group:
\deqn{Threshold = median - 1.2 Â· IQR}
\emph{*IQR: Interquartile range}

It indicates the trheshold from which down to consider EDY.
